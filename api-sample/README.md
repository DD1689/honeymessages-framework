# Connect to Honeymessages Framework

This repository contains some thoughts and examples on how to use the Honeymessages API.

## Usage

You need Node.Js, e.g., v17.8.0.

First, install the Node packages the examples are using with:

```bash
npm install
```

To see if the connection works, you can use the `test.js` file.
Run it with `node test.js` and see if it was able to fetch the users.

Then run the example with:

```bash
npm run start
# or
node main.js
```
